# Tranco List, ID: 5X83N

This is the log of which sites were selected for the WF-list from the Tranco List with ID 5X83N (August 12, 2025)

Selection methodology is documented where relevant; in almost all cases, the process simply involved navigating through any links found on the landing/main page until having 10 suitable pages within the same domain that matched criteria established by other selected links (relatively similar in nature/content)

After gathering all 1000 URL:s, we randomize the order of each of the 10 URLs for each site in the list, in an effort to remove any accidental information leak only due to their ordering.
